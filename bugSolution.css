The issue lies in the inconsistent use of units and lack of spaces around the mathematical operators. Ensure that there are spaces around the +,-,*,/ operators within the `calc()` function and that units are consistently used.

**Incorrect:**
```css
.element { width:calc(100%-10px); }
```
**Correct:**
```css
.element { width: calc(100% - 10px); }
/* Or if you want to use different units, make sure they're consistent and correctly converted. */
.element { width: calc(100% - 1rem); }
```
