The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it leads to unexpected results when combined with other properties or units. For instance, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not always subtract 10px from the 100% correctly, leading to layout issues. Another common mistake is forgetting the spaces around the operators (+,-,*,/) within the `calc()` function, which leads to parse errors.
